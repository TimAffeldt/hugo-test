### General Information About the Fee Program

1. **Why is there a Transportation Corridor Agencies fee program?**

   The Toll Roads were constructed using funds from the sale of bonds that are backed by future toll revenues and development impact fees authorized under Section 66484.3 of the California Government Code.
2. **Who established the program and what are the fees used for?**

   The Major Thoroughfare and Bridge Fee Program (Development Impact Fee Program) for the Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency (F/ETCA) and San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency (SJHTCA) was established by the County of Orange in 1985 and adopted by the member agencies through a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement (JPA). Development impact fees are collected for the purpose of planning, designing, financing and constructing the Foothill/Eastern and San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridors (State Routes 133, 241, 261 and 73), including repayment of debt issued to finance construction of the roads.
3. **How are fees assessed and how are they collected?**

   The program collects fees on new residential dwelling units or new non-residential square footage in areas surrounding the toll roads. Fees are assessed on a per unit basis for single family and multi-family residential units and on a per square foot basis for new or additional non-residential square footage. The County of Orange and member cities collect fees when a building permit is issued.
4. **What agencies assess these fees?**

   All Transportation Corridor member agencies assess the fee within the areas of benefit. The member agencies are the County of Orange and the cities of Aliso Viejo, Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Dana Point, Irvine, Laguna Hills, Lake Forest, Laguna Niguel, Laguna Woods, Mission Viejo, Newport Beach, Orange, Rancho Santa Margarita, San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, Santa Ana, Tustin and Yorba Linda.
5. **Where are the fees applicable and how much are the fees?**

   Each corridor has an Area of Benefit (AOB) within which fees are charged. Each AOB is divided into an "A" zone and "B" zone, with corresponding fee rates. Please refer to the map on this page to determine if your project falls within an AOB for the TCA fee program. In 1997, the Boards adopted a set rate of increase for the fees. Each July 1, rates for the F/ETCA fee zones increase by 2.206% and the SJHTCA fee zones by 2.667%. [Current rates for each corridor are available here (PDF)](https://thetollroads.com/sites/default/files/TCA%20DIF%20Rate%20FY21.pdf).
6. **How can I estimate the fees due on my project?**

   To obtain an estimate of fees due for a specific project, please use the map on this page and enter the address of your project. This map is a reference for estimating fees only. The exact fees due for any project will be assessed at the time of permitting by the member agency issuing the permit.
